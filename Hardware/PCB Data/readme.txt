This set of design files implements the PCB for the HD6309 Singleboard Computer v1.0

Design tool is Protel DX SE

PCB was designed with hand-soldering in mind, and to my own set of (largely unwritten) PCB
design rules. After more than 25 years of doing PCB layouts, I just sort of 'wing it'. As such,
the lands may be a bit elongated or otherwise non-IPC-ish. I also favor 0805 and 0603 passives, 
again in an attempt to enable easy hand-assembly.

My PCB were fabricated by OSHpark https://oshpark.com/ with only issue identified during
build-up: Y1 and Y2 are too close together (physically). Remedy: socket Y1 to raise it above Y2

PDF of the PCB can be found in the "CAM" directory.

The CAM for 6309mz_shift folder contains the files for an adapter board between the HD6309 SBC and
an Altera DE1 Cyclone FPGA development board. 

More up-to-date information on the SBC can be found on the Hackaday project page:
