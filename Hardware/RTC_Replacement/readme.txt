This set of design files implements a replacement for the Epson RTC7301DG realtime clock

Design tool is KiCAD v5.1.4

This is a hack to replace the 4-bit parallel Epson RTC7301 RTC with an I2C Maxim DS3232M RTC.
As such, it's not a 100% drop in replacement, and is intended ONLY for use with the HD6309 SBC!

PCB was designed with hand-soldering in mind, and uses the hand-solder KiCAD PCB footprints.
I favor 0805 passives, in an attempt to enable easy hand-assembly.

My PCB were fabricated by OSHpark https://oshpark.com/ 

More up-to-date information on the SBC can be found on the Hackaday project page:
